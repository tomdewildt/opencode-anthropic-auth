 * 400 invalid_request_error disguised as "You're out of extra usage."
 * Replacing the word "useful" (or removing it entirely) is enough to

 * so the model still sees the env-block intro.
 *
 * This was isolated via bisection: starting from a failing 10KB system
 * prompt, we sliding-window-deleted 1KB chunks until the request passed,
 * then narrowed to a 400-byte span, then to this single sentence. Both
 * removing and rewording "useful" pass; swapping "Here is" → "Here's"
