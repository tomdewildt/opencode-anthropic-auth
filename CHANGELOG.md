# @ex-machina/opencode-anthropic-auth

## 2.0.0-next.6

### Patch Changes

- The fork tag includes prebuilt `dist/` files and does not run a TypeScript build during npm Git-dependency preparation.

- [`506a687`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/506a687ac32613efbd28a446c04daca3fd41d965) Thanks [@Nyattie](https://github.com/Nyattie)! - Raise the request body limit from 10 MiB to 32 MiB to match the Anthropic Messages API, so image-heavy sessions are no longer rejected before they reach Anthropic.

## 2.0.0-next.5

### Patch Changes

- [#276](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/276) [`58cf3f4`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/58cf3f421c3bf7293ac1395bd1a4a3823fc2de68) Thanks [@rcdailey](https://github.com/rcdailey)! - Decode tool-name aliases when OpenCode reloads the plugin while a request is in flight. Previously the response reached a newer plugin setup that did not recognize the request, so the raw `mcp_T...` alias reached OpenCode and the tool call failed with "No tool named".

## 2.0.0-next.4

### Patch Changes

- [#275](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/275) [`447d42f`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/447d42f0468413bd25d3ce06d03052d0094f769d) Thanks [@1nk1](https://github.com/1nk1)! - Explain fast mode credit rejections instead of reporting an unclassified HTTP 429. When Anthropic answers a fast mode request with "Usage credits are required for fast mode.", the error now uses `category=fast-mode-credits`, states that fast mode needs usage credits (extra usage), suggests enabling extra usage or choosing a model without fast mode, includes a safe `overage-disabled` reason when Anthropic provides one, and is marked non-retryable ([#274](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/issues/274)).

## 2.0.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- [#269](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/269) [`2e3f5b7`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/2e3f5b7b0cd826225161f0198f40b45252cc9e92) Thanks [@1nk1](https://github.com/1nk1)! - Update the bundled Claude Code version to 2.1.280. When Anthropic returns the exact structured `claude_code_version_too_old` rejection with a newer real minimum, OpenCode v2 now uses that version consistently in the User-Agent and billing metadata and retries the initial request once. Explicit version overrides, malformed responses, unrelated HTTP 400 errors, and rate limits do not activate recovery.

## 2.0.0-next.2

### Patch Changes

- [#257](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/257) [`ee4b15c`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/ee4b15c93cbbd168df2035dbbcf30aa64c807d6e) Thanks [@CasualDeveloper](https://github.com/CasualDeveloper)! - Update the OpenCode v2 plugin SDK dependency and import to `@opencode/plugin@2.0.4`, following OpenCode's npm scope migration.

- [#250](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/250) [`7c34383`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/7c34383291118c30431f9ea328f0c048835abda2) Thanks [@1nk1](https://github.com/1nk1)! - Harden OAuth refresh rotation, request and response body handling, reversible tool-name aliases, and privacy-safe HTTP 429 diagnostics. Refresh requests are single-attempt and deduplicated across plugin instances so a potentially consumed rotating token is never replayed after an ambiguous failure. Update the bundled Claude Code fallback to 2.1.275 and bound the version override without reflecting malformed values into logs.

## 2.0.0-next.1

### Patch Changes

- [#229](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/229) [`774acbf`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/774acbfccf3d8d59b00147759ef1cfa4e3c531ee) Thanks [@eXamadeus](https://github.com/eXamadeus), @CasualDeveloper, and @johnnymo87! - Allow the reported Claude Code version to be configured via the `ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` environment variable. Anthropic gates model access on this value server-side and moves that gate on its own schedule, so a newly-gated model previously required waiting for a plugin release. Setting `ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` to a `major.minor.patch` value now overrides the bundled default for both places the version is reported — the `user-agent` header and the billing header's `cc_version` — which are resolved from a single value so they cannot disagree. The variable is read once at startup; a malformed value is logged as an error and the bundled version is used instead, and a value older than the bundled version is honored but logged as a warning, since reporting an older version is what triggers the gate in the first place. Thanks to @johnnymo87 for pointing out that a lower override silently defeats the purpose of the setting.

## 2.0.0-next.0

### Major Changes

- [#211](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/211) [`2d37ba5`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/2d37ba5a6f17acdf923540a906714e29ae40f373) Thanks [@CasualDeveloper](https://github.com/CasualDeveloper)! - Port the plugin to the OpenCode v2 plugin API ([#203](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/issues/203)). OpenCode v2 removed the v1 `auth` hook and provider `fetch` override that this plugin previously relied on, so this is a breaking change:

  - The package now exports a v2 `Plugin.define({ id, setup })` default export instead of the v1 named `AnthropicAuthPlugin` function. **This release is no longer loadable by OpenCode v1** — pin to a `1.x` release if you're still on OpenCode v1.
  - Claude Pro/Max OAuth is now registered through `ctx.integration.transform`, with token refresh wired into OpenCode v2's integration refresh lifecycle (still with a plugin-level single-flight guard to protect against concurrent refresh requests racing a rotating refresh token).
  - Anthropic request/response rewriting (OAuth headers, beta flags, body/tool-name transforms, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) now runs through `ctx.session.hook('http.request' | 'http.response', ...)`, gated to native Anthropic requests using this plugin's OAuth connection.
  - The "Create an API Key" console OAuth method (which minted and stored an Anthropic API key) is not included in this release — OpenCode v2's plugin API doesn't yet support an OAuth flow that ends in a stored API key. Manual API key entry and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` continue to work via OpenCode's built-in Anthropic integration.
  - Anthropic models retain their API price display in OpenCode v2. The beta Promise API cannot cancel the event subscription needed to keep OAuth-dependent catalog costs synchronized safely.
  - `ANTHROPIC_INSECURE` is not supported under OpenCode v2: request hooks can rewrite a `Request` but cannot disable TLS verification for it. The plugin now logs a warning instead of silently leaving it unapplied.
  - `@opencode-ai/plugin` is a pinned production dependency on the `0.0.0-next-17444` prerelease that introduced the v2 promise plugin API used here.

### Patch Changes

- [#218](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/218) [`988d87c`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/988d87c93ef0a61d4833299ef87e846c895b2f0d) Thanks [@1nk1](https://github.com/1nk1)! - Handle CR-delimited SSE events and reject oversized newline-free stream lines.

- [#230](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/230) [`ee40de9`](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth/commit/ee40de927843a80fbb52f99a54c244ace4371cbe) Thanks [@eXamadeus](https://github.com/eXamadeus)! - Carry the reported Claude Code version bump (`2.1.87` → `2.1.258`) into the v2 release line. Anthropic gates model access on this value server-side, so newer models were rejected with a 400 `claude_code_version_too_old`: "Claude Code 2.1.87 does not support this model; version 2.1.251 or newer is required". `USER_AGENT` is derived from `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` instead of repeating the version in a second literal, so future bumps only need to change one constant.

  The code already reached `v2/main`, but its original changeset was consumed by the v1.8.2 release on `main`, so this restates the release note for the v2 changelog.

This exact phrase ships verbatim in OpenCode's default system prompt and is used by Anthropic's server-side classifier as a third-party-agent fingerprint — matching it produces a 400 invalid_request_error disguised as "You're out of extra usage." in production. The sentence is now rewritten in place to a semantic equivalent so the model still sees the env-block intro while the request is accepted.
